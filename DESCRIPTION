Description: A method to identify differentially methylated segments from high
    density chip data. The algorithm works in two stages. First, the probes are
    segmented into consecutive regions with similar difference between sample
    groups. Then, the statistical tests are run on top of the identified
    regions to rank them based on the statistical significance.
